FACTS Devices for Power System Stability - README

Objective

This project implements Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) to improve grid stability. The simulation models STATCOM, SVC, and UPFC to analyze voltage stability, real-time grid disturbances, and optimize reactive power compensation.

Key Features

FACTS Devices Implemented:

STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) for dynamic voltage regulation.

SVC (Static VAR Compensator) for reactive power control.

UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller) for real-time power flow control.

Voltage Stability Analysis:

Simulation of FACTS devices under different load conditions.

Evaluation of reactive power compensation impact on voltage stability.

Real-Time Grid Disturbances:

Sudden load variations.

Fault-induced voltage fluctuations.

Optimization:
